`Try{Finally}` is my coding blog for discussing programming technologies and posting code examples. I will be focusing on keeping things easy to understand. Too many coding articles, in my opinion, are data dumps that are informative but hard to follow.

For each post, I will provide, for you, my dear reader...

* A clear, focused goal
* <span name="gitclone">Git clone links - follow along at home!</span>
* Concrete examples
* Focused code snippets
* Approachable explanations

<aside name="gitclone">Git links provided when applicable</aside>

<span name="aside">and colorful asides</span>.

<aside name="aside">... like this one!</aside>

<!-- TODO: Highlight series and singles when I have one of each. I've broken the site into two main sections: **series** and **singles**. I write very similar posts in both, but in the first area, I chain many articles together in pursuit of a larger project, while in the latter, I reflect on ideas that stand alone.

I use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) to build this site, and I host it using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

[All content in this blog](https://github.com/d9n/tryfinally/tree/master) is open source and hosted on Github as well.

I chose the name `Try{Finally}` because of its [obvious programming relevance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exception_handling_syntax), but also because I came to realize that so many things I used to assume were hard to learn just took patience and repeated practice to figure out. <span name="tryfinally">So keeping on _trying_ until you _finally_ get it.</span>

<aside name="tryfinally">Yeah... That's the reason. Really. Whatever, let's just move on, shall we?</aside>

I've been a programmer since 2001, with ten years of that spent in the game industry. I'm currently working at Google on [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html).

d9n is a [numeronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeronym) for my full name. If you have any questions or comments and want to reach me directly, email me at <d9n.coding@gmail.com>.
