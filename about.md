`Try{Finally}` is my coding blog for chatting programming and posting code examples. For each article, I will provide...

* A clear, focused goal
* Git clone links - follow along at home!
* Concrete examples
* Approachable explanations

<span name="aside">and friendly asides</span>.

<aside name="aside">Like this one!</aside>

I chose the name `Try{Finally}` because of its [obvious programming relevance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exception_handling_syntax), but also I've encountered many concepts which seemed so hard to understand at first but just took patience and persistency to get my head around it.

<span name="tryfinally">So keeping on _trying_ until you _finally_ get it.</span>

<aside name="tryfinally">Yeah, yeah, groan if you must! It's my own blog. I'll call it whatever I want.</aside>

<!-- TODO: Highlight series and singles when I have one of each. I've broken the site into two main sections: **series** and **singles**. I write very similar posts in both, but in the first area, I chain many articles together in pursuit of a larger project, while in the latter, I reflect on ideas that stand alone.

I use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) to build this site, and I host it using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). [All content in this blog](https://github.com/d9n/tryfinally/tree/master) is open source and hosted on Github as well.

I'd like to call out the excellent online book [Game Programming Patterns](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/) for being an inspiration.
