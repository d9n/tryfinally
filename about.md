I've been a career programmer since 2001, with ten years of that spent in the game industry. I'm currently working at Google on [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html).

I use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) to build this site, and I host it using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). [All content in this blog](https://github.com/d9n/tryfinally/tree/master) is open source and hosted on Github as well. I do my text editing with [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/).

I'd like to call out the excellent online book [Game Programming Patterns](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/) for being an inspiration.

If you have any questions or comments and want to reach me directly, email me at <d9n.coding@gmail.com>.
