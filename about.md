My name is David Herman, but you can call me [d9n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeronym) (denine). It's shorter.

This blog is my home for **carefully crafted coding tutorials**. You can rely on all entries to provide:

* A clear goal
* Concrete examples
* Git clone links - follow along at home!
* Clearly labelled tips and warnings
* Approachable explanations

So make yourself comfortable, and share in some of the knowledge and patterns I've picked up over the course of a 20 year long programming career.

**Learn, discuss, and enjoy!**
