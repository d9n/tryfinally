### Site details

I use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) to build this site, and I host it using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). [All content in this blog](https://github.com/d9n/tryfinally/tree/master) is open source and hosted on Github as well. I do my text editing with [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/).

I'd also like to call out some inspirations:

- [Game Programming Patterns](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/), where I fell in love with asides.
- [Red Blob Games](http://www.redblobgames.com/), which uses interactive components to help break down and teach complex concepts.

### About me

I've been programming professionally since 2001, with ten years of that spent in the game industry. I'm currently working at Google on [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html).
