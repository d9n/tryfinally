A home for **carefully crafted coding tutorials**. Articles designed to teach, not to overwhelm.

For each entry, you can rely on me to provide:

* A clear, focused goal
* Concrete examples
* Git clone links - follow along at home!
* Clearly labelled tips and warnings
* Approachable explanations

I've broken the site into two main sections: **series** and **singles**. I write very similar posts in both, but in the first area, I chain many articles together in pursuit of a larger project, while in the latter, I reflect on ideas that stand alone.

I build and maintain this site using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
