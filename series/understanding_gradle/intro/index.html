          <p>Gradle is a build system. Most of the time you will
          use it to build a target library or application.</p>
          <p>Gradle, when run, looks for a <code class=
          "highlighter-rouge">build.gradle</code> file in the
          current directory. A working <code class=
          "highlighter-rouge">build.gradle</code> is included here
          for reference, but don’t worry about understanding it for
          now. We’ll make more sense of it later.</p>

          <p>Though at first glance a simple <code class=
          "highlighter-rouge">build.gradle</code> file may look
          like a bunch of data values, you are actually reading
          code, <span name="groovy">written in <a href=
          "http://www.groovy-lang.org/">Groovy</a></span>. If you
          wanted, you could add variable declarations, print
          statements, and all sorts of other logic throughout the
          script above. Groovy’s flexible syntax allows writing
          code that has a declaritive, data-like look and feel to
          it.</p>
          <aside name="groovy">
            No Groovy knowledge is required to complete this
            series.
          </aside>
          <p>You can think of Gradle as a framework designed to do
          all sorts of heavy lifting for your project. <span name=
          "ide">It can handle managing dependencies, collecting
          input files, compiling code, and much more</span>. In
          short, this means you can ask someone to clone your
          project and then type <code class=
          "highlighter-rouge">gradle compileJava</code>, and Gradle
          will do a whole bunch of magic to produce an output. For
          example, Gradle might download libraries from an online
          repository and copy intermediate files around before,
          say, generating an executable.</p>
          <aside name="ide">
            Often, this sort of work is handled by an IDE. However,
            if you allow Gradle to be the <a href=
            "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_source_of_truth">source
            of truth</a>, you let each programmer use whichever IDE
            they want - IntelliJ, Eclipse, emacs, vim, notepad -
            and maybe, <i>just maybe</i>, avoid a developer holy
            war.

          <p>Gradle has been growing in popularity as a build
          system for a couple of reasons.</p>
          <p><strong>It is JVM based</strong>, which means the one
          prerequisite is that you have to install Java before
          using it. And that’s it. If you are working on a Java
          project, you are already ready to go.</p>
          <p><span name="dynamic"><strong>It is a fully featured
          programming language.</strong></span> Gradle provides a
          flexibility that can be refreshing for projects with
          non-standard build steps. Compare this with its
          predecessor <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a>, a
          build system driven by static xml files, where running
          into a wall means writing and registering a custom plugin
          with their system. With Gradle, such issues can be worked
          around with a few lines added to a build script.</p>
          <aside name="dynamic">
            My thoughts on whether this is good or bad is
            irrelevant to this series, so I'll be sidestepping it.
            But rest assured, this is a point of contention for
            developers, and I'm sure you can start a flame war over
            it if you want to (somewhere else, please).
          </aside>
          <p><strong>It is cross platform</strong>. The importance
          of this can’t be overstated. Gradle has a solid story on
          Windows.</p>
          <p><strong>It is extensible</strong> via a rich, powerful
          plugin system. A plugin for managing Java projects is
          included out of the box, <a href=
          "https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/standard_plugins.html">
          as are quite a few other standard plugins if you’re
          curious</a>.</p>
          <p>And finally, <span name="android"><strong>Android has
          officially endorsed Gradle</strong> as the recommended
          build system for building Android apps</span>. The
          Android gradle plugin does a lot of work to hide much of
          the complexity that can normally creep up when you start
          buliding lots of different versions of your Android
          app.</p>

          official documentation can be found here</a>, and you
          should bookmark that link in case you need to deep dive
          into any Gradle feature later. However, I feel that it
          can come across an intimidating tome of information that
          doesn’t even have you writing your first build script
          until Chapter 44.</p>
          <p>When I’m learning, I want to see simple, contained,
          concrete, realistic examples. I want to tweak settings
          and see what happens. That’s exactly what I’ll provide in
          this guide, and I hope this series acts as a useful
          supplement to the official materials.</p>

          <p>Instead of running <code class=
          "highlighter-rouge">gradle</code> directly, you will
          almost always run <code class=
          "highlighter-rouge">gradlew</code> instead.</p>
          <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">gradlew</code> is
          short for “gradle wrapper”, because it wraps an inner
          copy of <code class="highlighter-rouge">gradle</code>,
          offering indirect access to it. You can think of
          <code class="highlighter-rouge">gradlew</code> as being a
          snapshot of a particular <code class=
          "highlighter-rouge">gradle</code> instance. Whereas
          <code class="highlighter-rouge">gradle</code> would be
          installed somewhere generically on your system (like
          /usr/local/bin), <code class=
          "highlighter-rouge">gradlew</code> should be dropped into
          the project’s root directory (and checked into source
          control).</p>
          <p><span name="installgradle">If you have <code class=
          "highlighter-rouge">gradle</code> installed on your

          "highlighter-rouge">gradle wrapper</code>:</p>

            If you don't have gradle installed and want to install
            it, <a href=
            "https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/installation.html">
            visit the official docs</a> for more information.
          </aside>
          <p>By running <code class=
          "highlighter-rouge">gradlew</code>, you can be sure
          you’re running the <code class=
          "highlighter-rouge">gradle</code> version that the
          original author tested against. This is important as
          newer major versions of gradle may break backwards
          compatibility (or have different default behavior that
          may also affect the build). It also means a user can
          build your project even if they never installed
          <code class="highlighter-rouge">gradle</code>
          themselves.</p>
          <p>I will start refering to <code class=
          "highlighter-rouge">gradlew</code> for the rest of this
          series, but remember that conceptually <code class=
          "highlighter-rouge">gradlew</code> is just <code class=
          "highlighter-rouge">gradle</code> and accepts the same
          inputs.</p>
          <h3 class="link-header" id="tasks">Tasks<a href="#tasks"
          class="section-anchor"><span class=
          "fa fa-link"></span></a></h3>
          <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">gradlew</code>, when
          run, reads the current folder’s build script (if any) and
          prints out a list of tasks to the console.</p>
          <p>A task is a named, isolated unit of work which is one
          part of the overall build. Additionally, a task can
          depend on other tasks (meaning those tasks should run
          first). In this way, simple tasks chain together to
          perform complex logic.</p>
          <p>A concrete example will help illustrate this. Here are
          a subset of the tasks that might be listed when you run
          <code class="highlighter-rouge">gradlew tasks</code> on a
          configured Java project:</p>
          <p><img src=
          "/trypp/assets/series/understanding_gradle/intro/java_tasks.png"
          alt=
          "An example flowchart of some Java tasks generated by Gradle and how they depend on one another."></p>
          <p>Each box above represents a task (description +
          <b><i>task name</i></b>). Tasks without any other tasks
          depending on them are emphasized with a bold outline for
          clarity, but otherwise there is nothing technically
          special about them.</p>
          <p>Running <code class="highlighter-rouge">gradlew
          &lt;task_name&gt;</code> will run that task, as well as
          any prerequisite tasks. In practice, you probably won’t
          run intermediate tasks directly. But you can if the need
          arises.</p>
          <p>So in the above example, <code class=
          "highlighter-rouge">gradlew clean</code> is a standalone
          task that simply deletes the contents of a build
          directory. <code class="highlighter-rouge">gradlew
          run</code>, on the other hand, will compile code, process
          resources, package everything together, and then run the
          application. <code class="highlighter-rouge">gradlew
          javadoc</code> and <code class=
          "highlighter-rouge">gradlew run</code> rely on a bunch of
          the same tasks, so calling one and then the other will
          share a lot of the work from the previous call.</p>
          <p>Tasks are defined by declaring them with the
          <code class="highlighter-rouge">task</code> keyword and
          <span name="leftshift">setting them to a block with the
          left-shift operator</span>:</p>
          <figure class="highlight">
            <pre><code class="language-groovy" data-lang=
            "groovy"><span class="n">apply</span> <span class=
            "nl">plugin:</span> <span class="s1">'java'</span>

<span class="n">task</span> <span class="n">run</span> <span class=
"o">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="o">{</span>

<span class="o">}</span></code></pre>
          </figure>
          <aside name="leftshift">
            This works because Gradle overloads the left shift
            operator for defining tasks. Without it, the full code
            would be:
            <pre>
task run {
  doLast {
    ant.java(...)
  }

          "fa fa-link"></span></a></h3>
          <p>So, you want to compile your Java project. However, it
          depends on some library that, in turn, depends on
          another.</p>
          <p>One of the main jobs of a build system is to
          automatically manage these sorts of dependency
          relationships for you, and of course Gradle is no
          exception.</p>
          <p>You can think of dependency management consisting of
          three parts:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>dependencies</li>
            <li>configurations</li>
            <li>repositories</li>
          </ol>
          <h4 class="link-header" id="dependencies">
          Dependencies<a href="#dependencies" class=
          "section-anchor"><span class=
          "fa fa-link"></span></a></h4>
          <p>A dependency is pretty straightforward: it’s whatever
          your project relies on to compile or run. This is often a
          jar. To get this jar, you may download it from a server,
          find it on disk, or compile another gradle project on
          demand to produce it.</p>
          <p>When you specify a dependency, you must associate it
          with an existing configuration.</p>
          <h4 class="link-header" id="configurations">
          Configurations<a href="#configurations" class=
          "section-anchor"><span class=
          "fa fa-link"></span></a></h4>
          <p>A configuration is a group of related dependencies.
          For example, a fancy graphing calculator application
          you’re writing may depend on a math library and a
          graphics library, while your unit tests may additionally
          depend on a testing library and a profiling library. In
          this case, you would specify a main configuration
          (math+graphics) and a test configuration
          (testing+profiling).</p>
          <p>Note that the test configuration builds upon the main
          configuration. If you want to compile your unit tests,
          you must also compile the project itself. As you might
          expect, then, configurations can inherit from other
          configurations.</p>
          <p>Configurations are often created behind the scenes for
          you and you may never need to declare your own. For
          example, the Java plugin provides <code class=
          "highlighter-rouge">compile</code>, <code class=
          "highlighter-rouge">runtime</code>, <code class=
          "highlighter-rouge">testCompile</code>, and <code class=
          "highlighter-rouge">testRuntime</code> configurations,
          with the following inheritance rules:</p>
          <p><img src=
          "/trypp/assets/series/understanding_gradle/intro/java_configurations.png"
          alt=
          "An example flowchart showing the relationship of Java's compile, runtime, testCompile, and testRuntime configurations."></p>
          <ul>
            <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">compile</code> -
            dependencies needed when you compile your
            application</li>
            <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">testCompile</code>
            - dependencies needed when you compile your
            application’s unit tests</li>
            <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">runtime</code> -
            dependencies your code doesn’t compile against but will
            need when running. For example: a jar of
            theme-dependant icons, classes accessed through
            reflection, or a bundled executable that should be run
            by your application</li>
            <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">testRuntime</code>
            - same as “runtime” but only used by unit tests</li>
          </ul>
          <h4 class="link-header" id="repositories">
          Repositories<a href="#repositories" class=
          "section-anchor"><span class=
          "fa fa-link"></span></a></h4>
          <p>A repository is a large collection of dependencies.
          Think of it like a dragon’s hoard of treasure and gold.
          When you need to find a specific version of a specific
          dependency, you can root around inside a repository to
          look for one. Whereas a project would only reference a
          single version of a library at a time, a repository may
          store all versions of the library that ever existed.</p>
          <p>It’s usually good enough to specify <code class=
          "highlighter-rouge">mavenCentral</code> as your sole
          repository (which directs to <a href=
          "https://repo1.maven.org/maven2">https://repo1.maven.org/maven2</a>).
          <code class="highlighter-rouge">jcenter</code> is another
          common choice. You can even specify both repositories,
          and they will be searched in the order you listed
          them.</p>
          <p>It can even make sense for you to own a small, local
          repository with a handful of dependencies that you
          maintain yourself. For example, you might iterate on some
          library under development, hosting it locally until
          you’re satisfied it’s ready for release.</p>
          <h4 class="link-header" id="tying-it-all-together">Tying

          <p>Let’s revisit the example from the beginning as it
          should make more sense now.</p>
          <figure class="highlight">

          </figure>
          <p>Here, we are adding a single dependency, Guava v19.0,
          to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">compile</code>
          configuration, and another dependency, JUnit v4.12, to
          the <code class="highlighter-rouge">testCompile</code>
          configuration. The first time you ask Gradle to compile
          the project, it will download any missing dependnecies
          from Maven Central.</p>

          <p>Groovy, and by extension Gradle, makes a subtle
          distinction between ‘single quotes’ and “double quotes”.
          Double quoted strings are evaluated when they are read,
          and can contain code expressions that will be resolved at
          runtime. Single quoted strings, in contrast, are static.
          What you see is what you get.</p>
          <figure class="highlight">
            <pre><code class="language-groovy" data-lang=

"c1">// 5 + 5 = ${5 + 5}</span></code></pre>
          </figure>
          <p>You can think of double-quoted strings as a very
          convenient, concise way to represent Java’s <a href=
          "https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#format(java.lang.String,%20java.lang.Object...)">
          String.format(text, args…)</a> method call.</p>

            "o">));</span></code></pre>
          </figure>
          <p>When writing Gradle scripts, it’s a good idea to use
          single quotes if your text is static and double quotes if
          your text is dynamic. <span name="singlequote">At the
          very least, it’s important to know there’s a
          difference.</span></p>
          <aside name="singlequote">
            I learned this the hard way when I copied some text
            which was double-quoted. However, by trying to stay
            consistent with the rest of the script I was pasting
            into, I changed the double quotes to single quotes.
            Things broke.

          <h3 class="link-header" id="variables">Variables<a href=
          "#variables" class="section-anchor"><span class=
          "fa fa-link"></span></a></h3>
          <p>In Gradle scripts, you will commonly run across two
          types of variables: the standard kind (local variables)
          and a dynamic kind (extra properties).</p>
          <h4 class="link-header" id="local-variables">Local
          variables<a href="#local-variables" class=
          "section-anchor"><span class=
          "fa fa-link"></span></a></h4>
          <p>Local variables are declared normally just like any
          local variable you’d define in Java, such as <code class=
          "highlighter-rouge">String name</code> or <code class=
          "highlighter-rouge">File srcPath</code>. <span name=
          "def">You can also (and often should) use the
          <code class="highlighter-rouge">def</code> keyword which
          will let the compiler figure out the type for you</span>,
          and I do this in the example below.</p>
          <aside name="def">
            Some developers feel uneasy about this, as if losing
            type information somehow defeats the purpose of using a
            statically typed language. For example, <code>String
            name</code> is certainly more informative than
            <code>def name</code>, right? But if you fall in this
            camp, consider this example:
            <pre>
String result =
  getUser().
  getName().
  toLowerCase()
</pre>Verbosely, this can be rewritten as:
            <pre>
def user = getUser()
def name = user.getName()
String result =
  name.toLowerCase()
</pre>So, even if you didn't realize it, you have already been
relying on the compiler to handle intermediate values.

          <p>Local variables are useful for storing intermediate
          values as part of a function. Often, though, you just
          want to set a value in one place that you want to read
          back somewhere else.</p>
          <p>Gradle provides a way to do this through extra
          properties - using the <code class=
          "highlighter-rouge">ext</code> keyword, you can
          dynamically define variables that are then associated
          with the object at the current scope it is being defined
          in. Anywhere else in the same scope, you can later read
          that variable out again (without needing to use the
          <code class="highlighter-rouge">ext</code> keyword at
          that point).</p>
          <figure class="highlight">

          <p>The above sample works but is admittedly limited.
          However, extra properties can play a useful role
          especially when you write build scripts that spans across
          multiple projects.</p>
          <p>You should be aware that I’m glossing over this
          feature since we’re just focusing on the basics for now.
          Explaining the details of Gradle scopes would require a
          decent tangent, and you may never need to really
          understand them to get by. At this point, it’s just good
          to be aware of extra properties because you’ll often see
          the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ext</code> keyword
          used in practice.</p>
          <h3 class="link-header" id="buildscript-block">
          Buildscript block<a href="#buildscript-block" class=
          "section-anchor"><span class=

          <p>Normally a Gradle script is read from top to bottom,
          but an exception to that is the <code class=
          "highlighter-rouge">buildscript</code> block, which is
          always executed before everything else. You can think of
          it as a script within your script - Gradle will run over
          your code in two passes, first running the <code class=
          "highlighter-rouge">buildscript</code> block, and next
          running everything else.</p>
          <p>Why is this important? Well, it turns out it’s very
          useful for fetching custom plugins.</p>
          <p>For example, although the Java plugin is bundled with
          Gradle, the Android plugin is not. You could always make
          it a requirement for the user to download just the right
          version of the Android plugin before building their code,
          but this is something Gradle is already really great at
          doing! There should be some way to lean on Gradle to do
          this for us…</p>
          <p>And indeed, that’s what the <code class=
          "highlighter-rouge">buildscript</code> block is for.</p>

            code can be found and used as a dependency when
            building other code. Remember that your build script is
            code and is actually being compiled each time
            <code>gradlew</code> is called! The buildblock's
            classpath is actually providing dependencies for the

            <li>Gradle is used for building libraries and
            applications</li>
            <li>Gradle uses the Groovy language</li>
            <li>You’ll often invoke Gradle indirectly using
            <code class="highlighter-rouge">gradlew</code>, the
            “Gradle Wrapper”</li>
            <li>Gradle breaks a build up into tasks, and you can
            invoke tasks directly</li>
            <li>A configuration is a collection of
            dependencies</li>
            <li>The Java plugin includes useful configurations and
            build tasks that use them</li>
            <li>There are two types of variables: local variables
            (declared with <code class=
            "highlighter-rouge">def</code>) and extra properties
            (declared with <code class=
            "highlighter-rouge">ext</code>)</li>
            <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">buildscript</code>
            blocks run before everything else and provide
            dependencies for the rest of your build script</li>
          </ul>
