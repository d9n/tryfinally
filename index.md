`Try{Finally}` is my coding blog for chatting about programming and posting code examples I hope you'll find interesting. For each article, I will provide...

* A clear, focused goal
* Git clone links - follow along at home!
* Concrete examples
* Approachable explanations

<span name="aside">and friendly asides</span>.

I chose the name `Try{Finally}` because of its [obvious programming relevance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exception_handling_syntax), but also because I've encountered a good many concepts that were hard to grasp at first but became trivial to understand with a bit of persistence.

So keeping on _trying_ until you _finally_ get it.

Anyway, welcome. If you're looking for a place to get started, explore the <a href="series">{% icon fa-files-o %} Series</a> page for a good overview of available content.
