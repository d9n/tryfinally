I chose the name `Try++` because I've encountered a good many concepts that seemed daunting to grasp at first but became trivial to understand with a bit of persistence. Perhaps if you expand this philosophy out a bit more, you'd get:


{% highlight c %}
int try = 1;
while (!attemptToLearn()) {
    try++;
    sleep(100);
}
{% endhighlight %}

<span name="tripe">Also, the abbreviation _trypp_ can be pronounced "tripe" and that's the sort of thing I find disproportionately amusing.</span>

<aside name="tripe">This tidbit may actually communicate the essence who I am as effectively as I'd ever hope to capture in even the most comprehensive autobiography.</aside>

Anyway, welcome. If you're looking for a place to get started, explore the <a href="series">{% icon fa-files-o %} Series</a> page for a good overview of available content.
